## THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE SCRIPT!

This code is a stem that was written for a specific purpose and will probably never be anything more than this.

It can be forked, however, and taken further from here. It is a working AltspaceVR MRE that will do the following:

* Spawn a clickable button
* On click, spawns an unfiltered text input prompt
* On submit... well that's up to you!

All this does is get you the variable you'll need to save into your own schema. Good luck :)
